# optimization
Following are the assignments of Optimization course EE5327 in IIT Hyderabad

## ADAM - Optimization : 
The ADAM optimization directory has the implementation of various gradient optimization techniques implemented in python using only numpy.
It is the implementation of the paper - " ADAM: A METHOD FOR STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION "

## Requirements :
python3, Numpy

# We have used MNIST dataset for the verification. The whole code is written from scratch.

ADAM directory has a slides explaining the algorithms of the optimization techniques.
